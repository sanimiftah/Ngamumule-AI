# Ngamumule AI  
**Humanizing NLP through Cultural Storytelling**

A reflective, open-source initiative that explores AI literacy, NLP, and ethical design through Sundanese language, metaphor, and music.  
Rooted in care, crafted for context.  
**Ngamumule** means *to preserve* — this project does so through poetic prompts, ancestral instruments, and soft technology.

## ✨ Now Live on Lovable  
Ngamumule AI is now a mobile-first app built with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/71dc15e8-a05f-4902-929f-0279ad830e67) — a space where Sundanese wisdom meets ethical AI through storytelling, sound, and reflection.

The app experience evokes a quiet classroom in the mountains of West Java, with soft transitions, batik-inspired visuals, and multilingual support (Sundanese, Bahasa Melayu, English).  
It is designed to feel like technology that listens — gently, intentionally, and with cultural depth.

## 🌸 What’s Inside  
- Open-source learning units blending culture with computing  
- Audio-sensory reflections to build emotional resonance with AI  
- Frameworks for soft NLP and culturally aware edtech design  
- A poetic interface built with Lovable — where language becomes an interface of care

## 💡 Why Ngamumule?  
Because not all intelligence begins in code.  
Because oral tradition is a form of data sovereignty.  
Because language can be an interface of care.  
Because technology, too, can be soft.
