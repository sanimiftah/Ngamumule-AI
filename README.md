# Ngamumule AI  
Humanizing NLP through Cultural Storytelling

A reflective, open-source initiative that explores AI literacy, NLP, and ethical design through Sundanese language, metaphor, and music. Rooted in care, crafted for context. Ngamumule means *to preserve*â€”this project does so through poetic prompts, ancestral instruments, and soft technology.
