## 🌱 Project Overview

Ngamumule AI explores how traditional Sundanese narratives—such as *pantun*, *tembang Sunda*, and *wayang golek*—can inform and inspire AI literacy. By integrating cultural expression into educational tools, this project aims to build accessible, inclusive, and ethically grounded approaches to AI learning.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- 🧠 Design AI learning modules inspired by Sundanese metaphors and ancestral wisdom  
- 🗂️ Collect and annotate local content (e.g., *babasan*, oral narratives, traditional songs) to build an open, ethical dataset  
- 📱 Pilot a culturally contextualized learning app and toolkit  
- 🧩 Develop thoughtful frameworks for the ethical digitization of cultural knowledge  

---

## ❓ Key Research Questions

1. How can cultural narratives support deeper understanding and agency in AI literacy?  
2. What ethical considerations arise when translating oral heritage into machine-readable formats?  
3. Can localized, culture-based AI tools foster confidence and curiosity among young learners?

## 📦 Expected Outputs

- An open-access dataset of Sundanese language and symbolism  
- Prototype lesson plans, prompts, and educational materials  
- A pilot implementation report from workshops or classroom trials  
- Guidelines for culturally contextualized, community-centered AI design
